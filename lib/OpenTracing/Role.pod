=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package and related roles provide a set off attributes methods that will be
required by a OpenTracing compliant implementation. If these are missing, then
it may cause issues being compatible with other modules and or frameworks that
need the deeper voodoo magic inside Opentracing.
